# Saint's Study Guide

## Description

- I have long been thinking about what direction to take my career in and I finally decided I will go down a programming path
- I have built this project in hopes to create a location that can be a journal of what I learn during a bootcamp and my continous growth post-bootcamp
- This doesn't solve alot, more like it upgrade the typcial note taking practices from OneNote or Notepad for exmaple, to a dynamic journal of notes
- From this project I have learned a strong sense of how the layout of a page should look on the backend. I have also learned the importance of gitflow and version control
